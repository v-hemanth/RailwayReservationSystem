You can copy the code that i gave here and can run in any compiler using GNU GCC compiler(I used codeblocks).
Once you create a project and add this file to your project created using the compiler, you can build and run.
The code will automatially create the files for the railway database if you are running the code for the first time.
If you already have the database ready, place it in the project folder the code will automatically detect the railwaydbs file and you can proceed with the railway booking process.
Once the code is run, and you have created a login account in the Railway Booking process a text file under your name will be created and all the info regarding your booking process is stored in it.
Finally, you can exit the code and all the files will be saved securely for you to check the next time you run the code.
